          The task was to improve the effectivenss of MEDx's appointment manage page by making small visual
          modifications. An A/B test on users was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of these changes and
          decide whether we should implement them or not.

        <h3>Hypotheses</h3>

        <div class="body">
          <div class="background-separator" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <b>Misclick Rate</b> (the frequency with which the users click something else on the page before finding the
            correct button for the task):

            <div class="small-container">
              <p>
                <i>Null Hypothesis:</i> Version B has the same misclick rate as Version A

              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Alternative Hypothesis:</i> Version B has a lower misclick rate than Version A since the black
                colored text makes things easier to read.
              </p>
            </div>

            Prediction: I predict that we will reject the null hypothesis because changing the text color to black makes
            it easier to read the words and make users less prone to clicking the wrong button.

          </div>
          <div class="background-separator" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <b>Time on Page</b> (the time spent on the webpage for each user group before completing the task):

            <div class="small-container">
              <p>
                <i>Null Hypothesis:</i> Version B has the same time on page as Version A
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Alternative Hypothesis:</i> Version B has a lower time on page than Version A since the new structure
                of the appointment information makes it easier for users to navigate and find their desired appointment
                successfully.
              </p>
            </div>

            Prediction: I predict that we will reject the null hypothesis because the appointments are sorted in
            ascending date order, and the relevant information about the doctor and group are highlighted more
            prominently, making it easier to navigate to the desired appointment quicker.

          </div>
          <div class="background-separator" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <b>Time to First Click</b> (the amount of time that elapses before users make a first click):

            <div class="small-container">
              <p>
                <i>Null Hypothesis:</i> Version B has the same time to first click as Version A
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>Alternative Hypothesis:</i> Version B has a lower time to first click than Version A since the black
                colored text and structured ordering of appointment times by date will make it more intuitive for users
                to find their desired appointment.
              </p>
            </div>

            Prediction: I predict that we will reject the null hypothesis because the sorted order of dates will allow
            users to navigate to the appointment more quickly.

            <b>Test: </b>I conducted a Chi-Squared Homogeniety test for this metric since we are trying to determine if
            there is a significant difference in the distribution of did_mislick (which is a categorical variable).

          <p>
            <b>Analyis: </b>A chi-squared statistic of 0.6333 with 1 degree of freedom does not indicate a large
            discrepancy between the expected and observed frequencies of misclicks in versions A and B of the website.
            Furthermore, the p-value of 0.4261 is much greater than 0.05, which suggests that the difference in misclick
            rates between the two website versions is not statistically significant.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Conclusion: </b>Since the p-value is greater than the standard alpha level (0.05), we fail to reject the
            null hypothesis. The null hypothesis in this context would be that there is no difference in the misclick
            rates between the two website versions. Therefore, based on this test, we would conclude that there is no
            evidence of a significant difference in the misclick rates for versions A and B of the website.

            <b>Analyis: </b>The p-value of 0.0006707193483, or about 0.067%, is far below 0.05. This indicates that the
            probability of observing a difference as large or larger than the one observed is very small if there were
            actually no difference in the population means (null hypothesis). The negative T-score of -3.702419
            indicates that the average time on page for version B is significantly lower than for version A. The degrees
            of freedom are sufficient for the t-distribution to closely approximate the normal distribution, as it is
            greater than the standard 20 degrees of freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Conclusion: </b>Given the very low p-value in this updated data, we can reject the null hypothesis for
            the one-tailed test. This suggests that the difference in the time on page between versions A and B is
            statistically significant, with version A having a significantly longer time on page than version B.

            improvement, we should conduct more tests with additional data and metrics.
