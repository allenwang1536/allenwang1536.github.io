                    I was tasked to redesign the East Side Pockets website to appeal more to their target demographic.

                <p>
                    I chose to redesign the East Side Pockets Website because of the immediate contrast and organization
                    errors that jumped out to me. After a more thorough analysis of the site, I came up with the
                    following problems + fixes:

                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li class="text-li">
                        Navigation Simplification: Streamline the navigation by reducing the number of headers,
                        which will mitigate confusion and help users prioritize where to click. Organize content
                        under broad categories for easier access.

                    </li>


                    <li class="text-li">
                        Visual Hierarchy and Typography: Establish a clear visual hierarchy by using headers and
                        body text more appropriately. Ensure that headings stand out and guide the visitor through
                        the site, and that body text is easily readable for detailed information.

                    </li>

                    <li class="text-li">
                        Contrast and Readability: Improve readability by increasing the contrast between text and
                        background images. Add text shadows or placing text on semi-transparent overlays where it
                        overlaps with images to ensure the words are legible.

                    </li>

                    <li class="text-li">
                        Content Presentation: Make the welcome message and introduction to East Side Pockets more
                        prominent. It should be immediately visible and distinguishable from other elements to
                        effectively communicate the site’s purpose.

                    </li>

                    <li class="text-li">
                        Image Layout: Address the clutter of images by spacing them out and strategically placing
                        them to complement the text and other site content. Each image should be distinct to avoid
                        visual confusion and to allow each menu item to shine.

                    </li>

                    <li class="text-li">
                        Color Palette: Choose a color palette that complements the food and creates a warm, inviting
                        atmosphere. The color scheme should be consistent throughout the site, reinforcing the brand
                        and enhancing the aesthetic appeal.

                    </li>


                </ul>

                    <img src="../../images/east-side/waive.png" class="project-pic-full" />
                </div>
                <p>There weren’t many errors from the WAVE analysis besides a singular contrast error and a few alerts.
                    I agree with the contrast error; in general, the color scheme of the site should be fixed to match
                    better and have better contrast. The alerts seem mainly to concern the alternative text on the
                    images, which is an easily fixable coding issue.

                    I began the visual redesign process by sketching out 9 different frames of potential ideas, giving 1
                    minute to each frame. Then, I created a final sketch that drew components from each idea.

                    Then, I came up with the low-fidelity and high-fidelity designs based off my initial sketches and
                    the issues I was trying to solve (view the comments in red). The designs are in order of: desktop,

                    I used HTML/CSS + JS in order to create the website page. I started by initially plotting out the
                    overall layout of the page, then later polished the more granular details. One notable challenge I
                    ran into was the resizing of the screens. To fix this, I had to play around with custom font-weights
                    and image sizes / layouts at each different width breakpoint.

                    When I initially redesigned this website, I was a little overwhelmed because my mindset was to
                    redesign the entire site from scratch. However, I've learned that that's unecessary and that
                    designers will often imitate components from their favorite websites.

                </li>
                <li class="text-li">
                    <p>
                        Even with the above in mind, it was still difficult to figure out the style of the
                        site--specifically its layout and color. My personal favorite websites are clean, sleek, tech
                        blog type websites, so that's where I initially drew inspiration from. However, I quickly
                        realized that that didn't fit in with the message that East Side Pockets was trying to generate
                        (more of a ~home-y and earth-y feel).

                <li class="text-li">
                    <p>
                        I actually haven't created a pure HTML/CSS website before this (only React), and it surprised me
                        how simple but powerful the basics are. Perhaps I'll make more of these type of lightweight
                        sites.

                        Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to experience the full cycle of designing,
                        iterating, and prototyping a legitimate website. I'm really glad I took on this project and I'm
                        excited for future design works!
